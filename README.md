# Task Manager

## About
Task Manager is a web application that allows you to create users and tasks. I created this app to learn how to create a RESTful service and features encryption, a MongoDB database, a Test Suite, middleware such as authentication, environment variables, library mocking, and other Node.js tools.

## Feature List
#### 
    
#### Keep track of all the food in your kitchen
    - All your food is organized into 3 separate categories (Expired, Fresh, All).  
      This allows you to plan your food ahead of time without having to try to guess what you have at home
    - When your food is about to expire, the app will send you a notification so that you  
      don't end up throwing out that food you told yourself you'd eat (for the 100th time)
    - Refer to Step 2 for a preview
#### Collaborate with others
    - Create a House List that can be worked on by multiple people
    - Most of us don't live alone so why not invite your family or roommates - eat  
      like you want to and save money together

## How to
### Step 1 - Make A List And Check It Twice
First, you add the items you need to your Shopping List and you "Load" the item once you have loaded the Item into your cart. When you're done shopping, "Unload" to clear the list of all the stuff you purchased which will also add it to your Kitchen.

### Step 2 -  Manage Your Kitchen
Once it's in your Kitchen, you can tap on an Item to edit it's details such as how much of that item you bought, the store you bought it from, when it expires, and any notes you'd like to leave yourself. When you set an expiration date, the app will send you a notification reminding you that your item has expired.
