## About

## Requirements

## How to
### Step 1 - Make A List And Check It Twice
First, you add the items you need to your Shopping List and you "Load" the item once you have loaded the Item into your cart. When you're done shopping, "Unload" to clear the list of all the stuff you purchased which will also add it to your Kitchen.
